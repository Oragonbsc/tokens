# Introduction

![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

OragonX is a Fantasy Game platform project that uses the NFT system, in which every player will be able to earn income  by developing their own gameplay and contributing to the ecosystem. In the OragonX game, each player will be able to do breeding to boost up the dragon, raise, fight, and get items that can be used to improve the dragon’s ability.

OragonX will be a game full of enjoyment. In the future, it will become a new social media network because of the strong community, plus, it will give an opportunity to earn passive income. This game itself will give a new experience which is “Play to Earn” where the player in the ecosystem will get a reward. This will magnetize and fascinate millions of people, where you not just play the game, but you can get real income from the game itself. Amazing, right?!

Players will be able to get reward from:

* Do the best dragon breeding and sell it in the marketplace
* Sell items from the game
* Raise and improve the dragon up to certain rarity level, it will increase the price in the marketplace
* Victory reward from battle. ​
